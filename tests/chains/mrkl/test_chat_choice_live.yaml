      specifying a json blob.\nSpecifically, this json should have a `action` key
      (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input
      to the tool going here).\n\nThe only values that should be in the \"action\"
      field are: Terminal\n\nThe $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do
      NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\n\n```\n{{\n  \"action\":
