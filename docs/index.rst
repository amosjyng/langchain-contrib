   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to langchain-contrib's documentation!
=============================================

This is a collection of utilities that are too experimental for [LangChain proper](https://langchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), but are nonetheless generic enough to potentially be useful for multiple projects. Currently consists of code dumped from [ZAMM](https://github.com/amosjyng/zamm), but is of course open to contributions with lax procedures.

To get started, check out how to use the :ref:`Persistent Terminal </tools/persistent_terminal.ipynb>`.
